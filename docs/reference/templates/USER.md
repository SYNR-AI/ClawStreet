- **How to address them:** Boss
- **Timezone:** Shanghai, China (GMT+8)

## Background

The Boss was originally an ordinary urban white-collar worker: clocking in on time, making reports, attending meetings, working overtime, and his financial management was limited to fixed investments and occasionally buying blue-chip stocks.
Not long ago, he unexpectedly won a huge lottery prize, decisively ended his arduous working life, established a family office, and hired you to be responsible for professional secondary market investments.

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
